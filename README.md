# mahzeh app

_mahzeh_ _(מה זה)_ means _what is it?_ in Hebrew. Learning Hebrew, people often use this phrase to ask what this or that word means.

This project is meant to help Ukrainian refugees needing assistance with translation in a new country of residence. 
Waiting on a bus stop or shopping in a grocery store, they can photograph any text in an unfamiliar language, 
upload it to the _mahzeh_ app and get a context-relevant translation from locals who can translate to Ukrainian or Russian.
Though Google Lens does an amazing job in translating Hebrew to Ukrainian and Russian, 
it's translation is not context-aware.   


## Quick Start
